## Running tests

To run the tests:

    $ python -m unittest discover -s tests

## Raising issues

Please verify that the tests pass before raising an issue.  Failing tests on
one of the supported platforms (Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4) is an issue in its own
right.

## Creating pull requests

Please submit only one bugfix or enhancement per pull request, and please add a
test case for the feature you are fixing/improving.

By creating a pull request, you are authorizing the transfer of copyright
ownership of the code in the pull request to the original author of the project
