##bde-meta - build and test BDE-style code

### SYNOPSIS

`bde-meta [--root ROOT] [--flag NAME:FLAG] MODE ...`<br/>

Where `MODE` is one of:

`bde-meta walk GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bde-meta flags GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bde-meta ninja GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bde-meta runtests [TEST ...]`:

### DESCRIPTION

`bde-meta` is a set of basic tools to assist building and testing [BDE-style
source trees](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde).  It can generate [ninja build
files](https://github.com/martine/ninja) for a particular package group,
provide `flags` (`-I` and `-L/-l` rules by default, along with any
user-supplied ones) when building applications that depend on such package
groups.  It can also run all the unit tests for a particular package group.

`bde-meta` supports finding package groups across [disconnected
directory structures](#roots), [arbitrary flags](#flags) for any given
dependency, and [dependencies that are not actually package groups](#units).

`bde-meta` will insert the contents of `~/.bdemetarc` as if they were command
line flags before any flags specified on the command line.

### INSTALLATION

Place `bde-meta.py` in your `$PATH` somewhere. Personally, I symlink it to
`~/bin/bde-meta` and have `~/bin` in my `$PATH`.

This requires either of the latest versions of Python 2 or Python 3.

### OPTIONS

`bde-meta` takes any number of the following options:

  * `--root ROOT`
    Add the specified `ROOT` to the package group search path

  * `--flag NAME:FLAG`
    Append the specified `FLAG` when generating flags for the dependency
    with the specified `NAME`.

`bde-meta` runs in one of five modes as given by the first positional argument:

  * `walk GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Walk and topologically sort dependencies

  * `flags GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Produce flags for building dependents

  * `ninja GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Generate a ninja build file

  * `runtests [TEST ...]`:
    Run BDE-style unit tests

### ROOTS
<a name="roots"></a>

`bde-meta` will look for package groups in directories specified by (possibly
multiple) `--root` arguments.  This makes it easy to build code across multiple
BDE-style repositories, including your own.

### FLAGS
<a name="flags"></a>

Compiler and linker flags may be specified in addition to the ones generated by
the structure of the package group.  These are specified by supplying
`--flag NAME:FLAG` where `NAME` specifies the name of the dependency.
For example, specifying `--flag BSL:-DBDE_BUILT_TARGET_EXC` will provide that
as a flag for `bsl` and every dependent of `bsl`.

### UNITS
<a name="units"></a>

`bde-meta` supports dependencies that are not package groups (i.e. 'units').
This can be useful when depending on headers and libraries provided by the
system.  By default, such dependencies introduce no new flags unless such a
flag has been specified with a `--flag NAME:FLAG`.

### EXAMPLES

To build a static library named `bsl` in `out/lib`:

    $ ninja -f <(bde-meta ninja bsl)

To build `bdl` and all its dependencies as separate libraries in `out/lib`:

    $ ninja -f <(bde-meta ninja bdl)

To build all tests in the `bdl` package group using `ninja`, first build the
library (and all dependent libraries), then build the tests:

    $ ninja -f <(bde-meta ninja bdl) tests

To run all of the previously built tests:

    $ bde-meta runtests

To build `m.cpp` with `bdl` as a dependency and link it with all its
dependencies:

    $ c++ $(bde-meta flags bdl) m.cpp
