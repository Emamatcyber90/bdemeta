##bdemeta - build and test BDE-style code

### SYNOPSIS

`bdemeta [--root ROOT] [--cflag NAME:FLAG] [--ldflag NAME:FLAG] [--dependency NAME:DEPENDENCY] MODE ...`<br/>

Where `MODE` is one of:

`bdemeta walk GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta cflags GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta ldflags GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta ninja [-cc CC] [--cxx CXX] [--ar AR] GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta runtests [TEST ...]`:

### DESCRIPTION

`bdemeta` is a set of basic tools to assist building and testing [BDE-style
source trees](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde).  It can generate [ninja build
files](https://github.com/martine/ninja) for a particular package group,
provide `cflags`/`ldflags` (`-I`/`-L/-l` rules respectively by default, along
with any user-supplied ones) when building applications that depend on such
package groups.  It can also run all the unit tests for a particular package
group.

`bdemeta` supports finding package groups across [disconnected
directory structures](#roots), [arbitrary flags](#flags) for any given
dependency, and [dependencies that are not actually package groups](#units).

The contents of `~/.bdemetarc` and `.bdemetarc` will be considered as
command line flags in addition to those specified at invocation.

### INSTALLATION

Install using `pip`:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/frutiger/bdemeta

**Note**: the script name has changed from `bde-meta` to `bdemeta`.

### OPTIONS

`bdemeta` takes any number of the following options:

  * `--root ROOT`
    Add the specified `ROOT` to the package group search path

  * `--cflag NAME:FLAG`
    Append the specified `FLAG` when generating cflags for the dependency
    with the specified `NAME`.

  * `--ldflag NAME:FLAG`
    Append the specified `FLAG` when generating ldflags for the dependency
    with the specified `NAME`.

  * `--dependency NAME:DEPENDENCY`
    Consider the specified `NAME` to have the specified `DEPENDENCY`.

`bdemeta` runs in one of five modes as given by the first positional argument:

  * `walk GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Walk and topologically sort dependencies

  * `cflags GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Produce flags for compiling dependents

  * `ldflags GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Produce ldflags for linking dependents

  * `ninja [--cc CC] [--cxx CXX] [--ar AR] GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Generate a ninja build file

  * `runtests [TEST ...]`:
    Run BDE-style unit tests

### ROOTS
<a name="roots"></a>

`bdemeta` will look for package groups in directories specified by (possibly
multiple) `--root` arguments.  This makes it easy to build code across multiple
BDE-style repositories, including your own.

### FLAGS
<a name="flags"></a>

Compiler and linker flags may be specified in addition to the ones generated by
the structure of the package group.  These are specified by supplying
`--cflag NAME:FLAG` or `--ldflag NAME:FLAG` where `NAME` specifies the name of
the dependency, and `FLAG` the appropriate cflag/ldflag.  For example,
specifying `--cflag BSL:-DBDE_BUILT_TARGET_EXC` will provide that as a flag for
`bsl` and every dependent of `bsl`.

### UNITS
<a name="units"></a>

`bdemeta` supports dependencies that are not package groups (i.e. 'units').
This can be useful when depending on headers and libraries provided by the
system.  By default, such dependencies introduce no new flags unless such a
flag has been specified with a `--cflag NAME:FLAG` or `--ldflag NAME:FLAG`.  In
order to ensure that link lines are correctly topologically sorted, `bdemeta`
will require dependency information that can be specified with `--dependency
NAME:DEPENDENCY`.

### EXAMPLES

To generate the ninja build file for `bdl` and all its transitive dependencies
(i.e. `bsl`) into `build.ninja`:

    $ bdemeta ninja bdl > build.ninja

To build a static library for just `bsl` into `out/libs`:

    $ ninja bsl

To build a static library for `bdl` and each of its transitive dependencies:

    $ ninja bdl

To build tests for `bdl` and the tests for all its transitive dependencies:

    $ ninja tests

To build a specific test driver:

    $ ninja bsls_platform.t

To run all of the previously built tests:

    $ bdemeta runtests

To build `m.cpp` with `bdl` as a dependency and link it with all its
dependencies:

    $ c++ $(bdemeta cflags bdl) m.cpp $(bdemeta ldflags bdl)

To produce a set of cflags for third-party tools such as 'YouCompleteMe':

    $ bdemeta cflags bdl
