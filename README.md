# bdemeta

Build and test BDE-style code.

## Synopsis

`bdemeta walk UNIT [UNIT ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta cflags UNIT [UNIT ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta ninja UNIT [UNIT ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta runtests [TEST ...]`:

## Description

`bdemeta` is a set of basic tools to assist building and testing [BDE-style
source trees](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde).  It can generate [ninja build
files](https://github.com/martine/ninja) for a particular target (i.e. a
package group or an application) and its test drivers, and provide `cflags`
(`-I` rules by default, along with any user-supplied ones) required to build
any particular target.  It can also invoke BDE-style test drivers.

`bdemeta` supports finding targets across [disconnected directory
structures](#roots), [arbitrary flags](#flags) for any given dependency, and
[dependencies that are not actually targets](#units).

## Installation

Platforms running Python 2.7, 3.3 or 3.4 are supported.  Install using `pip`:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/frutiger/bdemeta

## Modes

`bdemeta` runs in one of four modes as given by the first positional argument:

  * `walk UNIT [UNIT ...]`:<br/>
    Walk and topologically sort dependencies

  * `cflags UNIT [UNIT ...]`:<br/>
    Produce flags for compiling dependents

  * `ninja UNIT [UNIT ...]`:<br/>
    Generate a ninja build file for building units

  * `runtests [TEST ...]`:<br/>
    Run unit tests

## Configuration

`bdemeta` is configured by mixing in the JSON configuration files in
`~/.bdemetarc` and then `.bdemetarc` (i.e. from the current working directory).
The configuration is as follows:

    {
        "roots": ["<root>", ...],
        "ninja": {
            "cc":  "<cc>",
            "c++": "<c++>",
            "ar":  "<ar>"
        },
        "units": {
            "#universal": {
                "external_cflags": ["<univ_cflag>",  ...]
            },
            "<unit>": {
                "internal_cflags": ["<int_cflag>",  ...],
                "external_cflags": ["<ext_cflag>",  ...],
                "ld_args":         ["<ld_arg>",     ...],
                "deps":            ["<other_unit>", ...]
            },
            ...
        }
    }

The specified `<root>`s are added to the target search paths.

The optionally specified `<cc>`, `<c++>` and `<ar>` are used as the C compiler,
C++ compiler and library archiver respectively.  If unspecified, these default
to `cc`, `c++` and `ar` respectively.

The cflags used to build components in the specified `<unit>` will be preceded
by the optionally specified `<int_cflag>` and `<ext_cflag>`, while those used
to build components in any unit that depends on `<unit>` will be preceded by
`<ext_cflag>` only.  The optionally specified `<univ_cflag>` is appended when
generating cflags for any component.

The optionally specified `<ld_arg>` is appended when determining linker input
for test drivers in or dependent applications of the specified `<unit>`.

The optionally specified `<other_unit>` is considered to be a dependency of the
specified `<unit>`.

### Roots

`bdemeta` will look for targets in directories specified by (possibly multiple)
`<root>`s in the configuration.  This makes it easy to build code across
multiple BDE-style repositories, including your own.

### Flags

Compiler flags may be specified in addition to the ones generated by the
structure of the target.  Flags required for all dependents of a given
package or target are specified via `<ext_cflag>`s for the appropriate
`<unit>` in the configuration.  Flags required only when building components or
test drivers within a package or target are specified via `<ext_cflag>`s for
the appropriate `<unit>` in the configuration.

### Linker arguments

A given target may require some additional system-provided or externally built
libraries.  These can be supplied using the `<ld_arg>` configuration option for
any given target.  If such a linker dependency is a real file, its modification
time will be considered when performing rebuilds.  Otherwise, it will always be
assumed to be up-to-date.

### Units

`bdemeta` supports dependencies that are not targets (i.e. 'units').  This can
be useful when depending on headers and libraries provided by the system.  By
default, such dependencies introduce no new cflags unless such a flag has been
specified with an internal or external cflag and no new linker input unless
such an input has been specified in the configuration.  In order to ensure that
link lines are correctly topologically sorted, `bdemeta` will require
dependency information that can be specified in the with `deps` section of the
configuration.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate working with the ['BDE' source
code](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde) on a Mac OS X with the Xcode
Commandline Tools installed.

First, clone the 'BDE' repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/bde

Next, go into your build directory and craft the following `.bdemetarc` file in
that directory:

    $ cd /path/to/build/directory
    $ cat .bdemetarc
    {
        "roots": [
            "/path/to/bde/clone"
        ],
        "units": {
            "bsl": {
                "external_cflags": ["-DBDE_BUILD_TARGET_EXC", "-DBDE_BUILD_TARGET_MT"]
            },
            "bdl+decnumber": {
                "internal_cflags": ["-I/path/to/bde/clone/groups/bdl/bdl+decnumber/common"]
            }
        }
    }

Note that the special 'bdl+decnumber' cflag is needed as that package has
special build rules.

### Example 1: Building and testing package groups

First, test that the dependencies can be traversed correctly:

    $ bdemeta walk bdl
    bdl bsl

Next, generate the ninja build file for `bdl` and all its transitive
dependencies (i.e. `bsl`) into `build.ninja`:

    $ bdemeta ninja bdl > build.ninja

Then, build a static library for just `bsl` into `out/libs`:

    $ ninja bsl

Next, build a static library for `bdl` and each of its transitive dependencies:

    $ ninja bdl

Then, build a specific test driver:

    $ ninja bsls_platform.t

Next, build test drivers for a specific package group:

    $ ninja bsl.t

Then, build test drivers for all package groups:

    $ ninja tests

Next, run a specific test driver:

    $ bdemeta runtests bsls_platform.t

Finally, run all previously built test drivers:

    $ bdemeta runtests

### Example 2: Building an application package

First, create a root for your application code:

    $ mkdir -p /my/root

Then, create an 'applications' directory inside it.  This will contain all the
application standalone packages.

    $ mkdir /my/root/applications

Next, create a standalone package for your application, called `m_myapp`:

    $ mkdir /my/root/applications/m_myapp

Then, create the metadata for this application:

    $ mkdir /my/root/applications/m_myapp/application
    $ echo 'bsl' > /my/root/applications/m_myapp/application/m_myapp.dep
    $ echo 'myapp.m.cpp' > /my/root/applications/m_myapp/application/m_myapp.mem

Next, go to your build directory:

    $ cd /path/to/build/directory

Then, add your new root to your `.bdemetarc` file:

    $ sed -i '3A,' .bdemetarc
    $ sed -i '4i        "/my/root"' .bdemetarc
    $ cat .bdemetarc
    {
        "roots": [
            "/path/to/bde/clone",
            "/my/root"
        ],
        "units": {
            "bsl": {
                "external_cflags": ["-DBDE_BUILD_TARGET_EXC", "-DBDE_BUILD_TARGET_MT"]
            },
            "bdl+decnumber": {
                "internal_cflags": ["-I/path/to/bde/clone/groups/bdl/bdl+decnumber/common"]
            }
        }
    }


Next, test that the dependencies can be traversed correctly:

    $ bdemeta walk m_myapp
    m_myapp bsl

Then, generate the ninja build file into `build.ninja`:

    $ bdemeta ninja m_myapp > build.ninja

Finally, build your application into `out/apps`:

    $ ninja m_myapp

### Example 3: Generating cflags for external tools

Some external tools, e.g. 'YouCompleteMe' require a list of cflags.  To
generate valid cflags, simply run the following command:

    $ bdemeta cflags bdl
